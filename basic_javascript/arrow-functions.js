/*
Arrow functions in javascript are concise syntax for writing functions,
introduced in ES6. They are also known as lambda functions. They
simplify function expressions and behave differently than the traditional
functions in some ways.

Usecases:
1. Callbacks
2. Event listeners
3. Array methods
4. Promises
5. Higher order functions
6. As object methods
7. As constructors
8. As generators
9. As async functions
10. As IIFE
